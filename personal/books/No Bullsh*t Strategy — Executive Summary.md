# No Bullsh*t Strategy — Executive Summary

Page 1

- Book Overview (2-3 sentences)
No Bullsh*t Strategy by Alex Smith is a sharp, practical guide to building a strategy that actually drives execution. It strips away buzzwords and slideware to focus on a few clear choices that align the company, concentrate resources, and move core metrics. It’s built for founders who need clarity fast.

- Key Thesis (1 paragraph)
Strategy is a set of explicit, mutually reinforcing choices about where you will play, how you will win, and what you will not do—translated into concrete bets, metrics, and weekly behaviors. Most startups don’t fail for lack of ideas but for lack of focus and trade-offs. The remedy is a tight, testable strategy: define the customer and problem narrowly, pick a compelling edge, concentrate resources behind a simple operating system, and create feedback loops that kill bad bets quickly while scaling what works.

- Top 3-5 Actionable Insights
1) Choose a sharp who and problem
- Define an ICP by pain, not demographics: urgent, frequent, monetizable.
- Tighten scope: eliminate edge cases and “nice-to-haves.” Depth beats breadth early.

2) Differentiate through a single decisive edge
- Pick one: distribution edge (access to a hard-to-reach channel), product edge (10x on a narrow job), or model edge (pricing/packaging/automation that flips unit economics).
- Make the edge visible in your positioning: one line that a buyer repeats.

3) Align strategy to operating cadence
- Translate choices into specific weekly inputs: target accounts, experiments, feature bets, and constraints. If it doesn’t change a calendar, it’s not strategy.
- Use a 6-week cycle: commit, execute, review, and reallocate.

4) Resource ruthlessly
- Concentrate 70% of effort on the single highest-leverage bet, 20% on enabling systems (data, tooling, hiring), 10% on optionality. Kill zombie projects.

5) Build a metric spine
- Pick one north-star outcome (e.g., weekly active payers, retained teams on month 3) and 3 input metrics you directly control (e.g., qualified demos/week, activation step completion, cycle time). Review weekly.

- Relevance to Startup Phase
- Idea validation: Tight ICP, sharp problem framing, fast qualitative loops.
- MVP: Single decisive edge and ruthless scoping; avoid kitchen-sink features.
- Product-market fit: 6-week operating cadence, metric spine, and resource concentration.
- Early growth: Distribution edge, scalable packaging/pricing, and kill-switches for projects that don’t move north-star.

- Implementation Guide (30-day plan)
Week 1: Strategy draft (founder-led)
- ICP: List 10 current/past users. Score pains by urgency (H/M/L), frequency/week, and willingness to pay. Pick 1 segment.
- Problem statement: [Who] can’t [job] because [constraint], costing [quantified pain].
- Edge choice: distribution vs product vs model. Write the one-line positioning.
- North-star: choose one metric and 3 input metrics.

Week 2: Operating system and resource focus
- 6-week cycle backlog: define 3 bets maximum, each with owner, expected impact on input metrics, and clear kill criteria.
- Resource allocation: 70/20/10 across the 3 bets, enabling systems, and optionality.
- Calendarize: add bets, standups, weekly metric review, and demo day to calendars.

Week 3: Experiments and plumbing
- Build 3 fast tests that express your edge:
  - Distribution: partner outreach script + 30-target list; measure reply→meeting→qualified rate.
  - Product: single “job-complete” path; measure activation to job completion time.
  - Model: pricing/packaging A/B on 10 discovery calls; measure close rate and ACV.
- Data plumbing: simple dashboard for the north-star and 3 inputs.

Week 4: Review and reallocate
- Post-mortem each bet against kill criteria. Double down on the top mover, kill or redesign the rest.
- Update positioning with real language from customers. Refresh the next 6-week cycle.

- Common Pitfalls
- Vague ICPs like “SMBs in X industry”; choose a pain-defined microsegment.
- Multiplying priorities; more than 3 concurrent bets erodes signal.
- Mistaking outputs for outcomes; shipping features without moving input metrics.
- Strategy as slides not schedules; no calendar changes means no behavior change.
- Sunk-cost fallacy; failing to kill non-moving bets due to effort already spent.

- Quick Reference Framework
1) Choice Stack
- Where to play: ICP defined by urgent, frequent, monetizable pain.
- How to win: single edge (distribution, product, or model).
- What not to do: explicit anti-goals and de-scopes.

2) Metric Spine
- North-star outcome + three controllable inputs reviewed weekly.

3) 6-Week Operating Cycle
- Commit (choose 3 bets) → Execute (70/20/10 focus) → Review (kill/double down).

4) Kill Criteria Template
- If input metric doesn’t improve by ≥X% in Y weeks, stop or change approach.

- One Critical Takeaway
Strategy is focus enforced by calendars and kill criteria: make a few explicit bets, wire them to weekly metrics, and reallocate relentlessly.
