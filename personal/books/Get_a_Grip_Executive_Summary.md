# Get a Grip – Executive Summary for Early‑Stage Founders

**Page 1**

**Book Overview**  
*Get a Grip* by Gino Wickman introduces the *Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS)*—a practical, step‑by‑step framework that helps businesses turn vision into reality and achieve sustainable growth.

**Key Thesis**  
Wickman argues that most companies fail not because of bad ideas but because they lack a simple, repeatable system to align people, clarify priorities, and execute consistently. EOS combines six key components—Vision, People, Data, Issues, Process, and Traction—to create an “operating system” that turns chaos into disciplined, measurable progress.

**Top 3‑5 Actionable Insights**
- **Define a 10‑Year Target & 3‑Year Picture** (p. 42‑44) – Long‑range clarity drives short‑term focus. Example: map a $10M ARR goal in 10 years, then break it into a 3‑year vision with market, product, and team milestones.
- **The “Accountability Chart”** (p. 78‑80) – Assign clear roles, not titles, to ensure the right people own the right outcomes. Example: replace a generic “CTO” with “Product Architecture – owns roadmap, tech debt, and platform stability.”
- **Weekly “Level‑10” Meetings** (p. 115‑117) – A 90‑minute structured meeting keeps the team on track, surfaces issues early, and drives rapid problem‑solving. Example: standing 9 am call, agenda (Scorecard, Rock Review, Issues), end with clear action items.
- **Scorecard Metrics** (p. 53‑55) – Track 3–7 leading indicators weekly; they predict health better than monthly financials. Example: early‑stage SaaS tracks “Weekly New Trials,” “Conversion Rate,” and “Customer Churn Rate” to pivot before cash‑flow problems appear.
- **Identify & Solve “Issues” at the Root** (p. 124‑126) – Use the “Identify‑Discuss‑Solve” (IDS) method to prevent recurring problems. Example: when a product launch stalls, isolate the core cause (onboarding friction) and assign a rapid experiment to test a fix.

**Relevance to Startup Phase**
- *Idea Validation & MVP*: Vision and 3‑Year Picture keep the team from over‑building.
- *Product‑Market Fit*: Scorecard metrics surface early adoption signals.
- *Early Growth*: Accountability Chart and Level‑10 meetings scale execution without added bureaucracy.

**Implementation Guide (30‑Day Action Plan)**
| Day 1‑7 | Draft a 10‑Year Target & 3‑Year Picture (1 page). |
| Day 8‑14 | Build the Accountability Chart: list current team, define “seat” responsibilities, identify gaps. |
| Day 15‑21 | Design a weekly Scorecard (3–5 leading metrics) and set up a shared dashboard. |
| Day 22‑28 | Launch Level‑10 meetings: create a static agenda template, assign a 90‑minute slot, train the team on IDS. |

**Common Pitfalls**
- *Over‑Planning*: Spending weeks perfecting the vision can delay execution; keep the 3‑Year picture to one page.
- *Title‑Centric Roles*: Assuming “CTO = tech” leads to unclear ownership; focus on outcomes, not titles.
- *Metric Overload*: Tracking >7 indicators dilutes focus; stick to the most predictive 3–5.
- *Skipping the IDS Loop*: “Issue” discussions become status updates; always drill to the root cause before assigning owners.

**Quick Reference Framework**
| EOS Component | Core Question | Practical Tool |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Vision | Where are we going? | 10‑Year Target + 3‑Year Picture |
| People | Who does what? | Accountability Chart |
| Data | How do we know we’re moving? | Weekly Scorecard (3–5 metrics) |
| Issues | What blocks us? | IDS (Identify‑Discuss‑Solve) |
| Process | What’s the repeatable way? | Documented Core Processes (e.g., onboarding) |
| Traction | How do we execute weekly? | Level‑10 Meeting agenda |

**One Critical Takeaway**
*If you can’t answer “What’s our 10‑year target and who owns the next 90‑day priority?” you won’t achieve traction.*
