# Sales Tips for Founders

## Discovery & Qualification

**Stop generic discovery. Use these exact questions:**
- What's the cost of not solving this now?
- Who else is involved in these decisions?
- What's blocked past attempts to fix this?
- How would success be measured?

*4 questions = complete qualification.*

## Demo Strategy

**Executive demo strategy:**
- Max 30 minutes
- 3 slides upfront
- 1 concrete ROI example
- 7 minute product tour
- Clear next steps

CEOs don't want features. They want:
- Revenue impact
- Cost savings
- Strategic advantage

*Keep it high level.*

**Turn your demo into a story:**
1. Current state (their pain)
2. Future state (the dream)
3. Bridge (your product)
4. Proof (customer examples)
5. Next steps

*Never demo features without context. Stories = 2x better retention than features.*

**Post-demo closing language:**
"Based on what we covered is this solution something you'd want to move forward with if we can align on commercial terms?"
- If yes = talk pricing
- If no = surface real objection

*No more endless follow ups.*

## Proposals & Pricing

**The winning proposal format:**
1. Current state costs ($X)
2. Future state savings ($Y)
3. Net benefit ($Y-$X)
4. Investment required ($Z)
5. ROI ratio (($Y-$X)/$Z)

*Make it a business case, not a price quote.*

**Example ROI math that makes prospects pay attention:**
You have 10 recruiters at $125k fully loaded cost = $1.25M annual spend. Our tool makes them 30% more efficient = $375k value created. We charge $50k = 7.5x ROI. Make the math dead simple.

**Pricing strategy for early customers:**
When you are selling your first few dozen customers, always be raising your prices. Was your first customer $99 a month? After you've gotten them on boarded and to success, the next prospect should be quoted $199. Did you successfully close somebody for $25,000 a year? Can you try for a two year contract next? Always be raising prices early on. Keep going until you are materially hurting your rates.

**The best pricing defense is future value:**
'Yes, we cost more today. But in 12 months when you need [upcoming feature], you'll thank yourself for choosing the platform that's investing in innovation.' Sell tomorrow's product today.

**Build your negotiations playbook early:**
- Standard discount tiers
- Acceptable payment terms
- Volume pricing breaks
- Multi-year incentives

*Don't make it up deal by deal. Consistency drives predictability.*

## Objection Handling

**When prospects say we don't have budget:**
1. Check renewal dates of similar tools
2. Look for discretionary budget pools
3. Find operational cost savings to fund it
4. Offer monthly payment (+20% to annual price)
5. Start smaller pilot scope

*Budget exists if value is clear.*

**The best objection handling formula:**
1. "Help me understand..."
2. "What I'm hearing is..."
3. "Other customers had this concern..."
4. "Here's how we addressed it..."
5. "Does that help resolve..."

*Validate → Empathize → Solve → Confirm*

## Deal Acceleration & Closing

**The deal acceleration playbook:**
1. Find end of quarter/year pressure
2. Identify budget flush opportunities
3. Offer 14 months for 12 price
4. Add bonus implementation support
5. Create urgency with pricing changes

*Speed > discount.*

**When deals go dark:**
Send a direct 'break up' email: 'We've missed a few meetings. While I believe we can deliver [specific value], I don't want to be a pest. Are we still a priority?'

*Often prompts real answers or resurrects deals.*

## Pilots & Trials

**How to structure pilots that actually close:**
- Max 30 days
- 3 mandatory training sessions
- Weekly usage metrics reviews
- 2 required use cases completed
- Success criteria defined up front

*Charge 25% of annual fee for the pilot. No more endless trials.*

**Pilot-to-paid conversion framework:**
1. Weekly success metric reviews
2. Bi-weekly stakeholder updates
3. End-user feedback collection
4. ROI calculation at day 20
5. Transition meeting day 25

*Structure = Wins*

## Follow-up & Conversion

**The post-demo email formula that gets responses:**
1. Thank you + key insight shared
2. 3 bullet recap of agreed value
3. Specific next step + time already agreed on call
4. Deck attached

*4 elements = guaranteed response*

**Block 15 minutes after all your sales calls:**
This includes note taking, CRM disposition, follow up emails, and task assignment. You will forget what was discussed, so note it down. If you can't finish relevant tasks (eg "draw up proposal") in the alloted time, use your follow up time to calendar further time dedicated to those needed tasks. But block the time after your calls so you can make the most of what transpired in those calls.

## Sales Activity & Tempo

**Enhance your sales tempo:**
One of the simplest things you can do to enhance your sales tempo is just create a goal for customer facing meetings in a week. That's it. You probably don't have a target (let alone a floor) for that. Do that, and you'll already be ahead of the game. If you're not having 10 customer facing meetings a week, there's probably something wrong.

**Get on the plane / train / Uber for that sales meeting:**
Had a mid-funnel meeting today. Could have been a zoom. But prospect HQ was only an hour BART / Uber away. So became an in-person meeting instead. Brought a bunch of gifts. Got face to face bonding time. Ended up whiteboarding a bunch. Make the trip. Zoom is not real life.

**Block your calendar like this for demos:**
- 15min pre-call prep
- 45min demo
- 15min post-call action time
- 15min buffer
- Result: 90min total block

*Never back-to-back demos. You're burning $500+ of marketing spend per demo. Give yourself space to execute.*

## Contracts & Renewals

**Your contract should have clear renewal terms:**
- Auto-renewal with 60-day opt-out
- Maximum annual price increase
- Minimum seat commitments

*Avoid renewal negotiation nightmares before they start.*


Founders: In early sales, look for natural pricing thresholds: - Under $100/mo for individual card swipes - Under $5k for team manager discretionary budget - Under $15k for department head approval Make it easy to say yes within existing constraints.

Founders: Your success metrics need 3 timelines: Quick Wins (30 days): - Implementation complete - Team trained - First workflow live Mid-term (90 days): - 50% adoption - 25% efficiency gain Long-term (180 days): - Full ROI achieved

Founders: The most powerful sales narratives follow a simple pattern: Problem → Pain → Current Solutions → Why They Fail → What Changed → New Solution → Proof Each part builds naturally on the last.

Founders: Don't obsess over pricing too early. Start by charging something - even if modest. If prospects don't blink at your price, raise it next time. Keep pushing up until you see it impacting close rates. Better to capture less value early and learn than optimize for perfect pricing day one.

Founders: Use your title as your superpower in outbound. I assure you, prospects don't fully understand how miserable being an early stage founder is. The title and fundraising seem glamorous and high status. Use that to your advantage in outbound when asking for meetings. Prospects are typically excited to network with founders* if you ask in an unassuming way positioned as learning from them. *even those who had to deal with an employee quitting this morning and the office's toilet being broken.
