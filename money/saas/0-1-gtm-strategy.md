   - Research top 3 points about each company
   - Have their LinkedIn open

2. **Call Script Framework**:

   "Hi [Name], I know you weren't expecting my call. 
   I'm [Your name] from [Company]. We help [their title] 
   at [their industry] companies [achieve specific outcome].
   
   The reason for my call is I noticed [specific trigger/reason].
   
   Do you have 27 seconds for me to tell you why I called, 
   and you can decide if we should talk further?"
   ```

3. **Track in CRM**:
   - Connected/Not connected
   - Interest level (1-5)

#### 8:30-9:00 AM: Email Outreach
**Target: 20 personalized emails/day**

1. **The "Curious Student" Framework - First Email**:
   ```
   Subject: need help
   
   Hi [First Name],
   
   I'm [Your Name], I'm the CEO and Co-Founder of [your company name], 
   and I recently [brief credibility statement - graduated from X, 
   built Y, raised funding from Z, etc.].
   
   I'm reaching out because I'm deeply interested in [industry] and 
   where [your expertise] can have the biggest impact. I'm looking to 
   connect with high level leaders who see the potential of [your solution] 
   but may not know where to start.
   
   I'd love to learn how your team operates and see if I can develop 
   some [custom insights/solutions] to make your life easier, completely free.
   
   I know this is a bit of a strange ask, I'm basically offering to come 
   in as a [free consultant / research partner] in exchange for learning 
   more about the challenges you face.
   
   Would love to chat if this sounds interesting, or if you could point 
   me in the right direction. At the very least, I'd be happy to share 
   a few [case studies/examples] of what's possible with today's 
   [technology/strategy].
   
   Best,
   [Your Name]
   ```

2. **Follow-up Email (4-5 days later)**:
   ```
   Subject: [same thread as email 1]
   
   Hi [First Name],
   
   Wanted to follow up. I know you probably get a bunch of emails like 
   this, but here's why this one's different:
   
   After studying CS at Stanford [example] and working on ML infrastructure 
   at Brex [example], I kept running into the same problem: no matter how 
   much automation we built, [whatever the big bottleneck was].
   
   None of my peers coming out of schools like Stanford, MIT, or Harvard 
   were focused on fixing the most painful, unsexy part of [industry your 
   targeting], things like [examples of the most mundane boring part]
   
   I really want to change that.
   
   So I started [your company name]. We're building [this, by solving this]
   
   I have nothing to pitch you. I'm just trying to learn how top 
   [whatever industry/vertical] teams operate and see if we can build 
   something genuinely useful.
   
   Would you be open to a quick call to help?
   
   No pitch, just a conversation.
   
   Best,
   [Your Name]
   ```

3. **Key Elements That Make This Work**:
   - Shows vulnerability ("need help", "strange ask")
   - Offers value upfront (free insights/solutions)
   - Demonstrates credibility without bragging
   - Focuses on learning, not selling
   - Creates curiosity about what insights you might offer

### Email Variations for Different Scenarios

#### Variation 1: The Research Angle
```
Subject: quick research question

Hi [First Name],

I'm [Your Name], founder of [Company]. We're researching how 
[specific role] teams at [company type] handle [specific challenge].

I noticed [Company] is [specific achievement/growth metric], and I'd 
love to understand how you're managing [challenge] at that scale.

In exchange for 20 minutes of your time, I'd be happy to:
- Share what we're learning from other [industry] leaders

No sales pitch - just trying to understand the real challenges 
before we build anything.

Open to a quick call next week?

[Your Name]
```

#### Variation 2: The Problem Validation
```
Subject: solving [specific problem] - am I crazy?

[First Name],

Quick question - is [specific problem] still a massive pain for 
[role/team] or have I been living under a rock?

I'm [Your Name], previously [built/worked at X]. After seeing 
[problem] kill productivity at 3 different companies, I'm building 
a solution.

But first, I need to make sure I'm not solving yesterday's problem.

Would you be open to a 15-min call where I can learn how you're 
currently handling [process]? Happy to share what other [industry] 
companies are doing differently.

No pitch, just validation. Deal?

[Your Name]
```

#### Variation 3: The Industry Insider
```
Subject: [industry] ops question

Hi [First Name],

I've been studying how leading [industry] companies handle [process], 
and [Company] keeps coming up as doing something different.

P.S. If you're not the right person, who should I talk to?
```

#### Variation 4: The Peer Learning
```
Subject: comparing notes on [challenge]

[First Name],

Are you folks still manually handling [specific process]? 

I'm [Your Name] - we're working with a few [industry] companies to 
solve this, but every team seems to have a different approach.

Would you be open to comparing notes? I can share:
- What's working at [Company A] and [Company B]
- The pitfalls they hit scaling past [metric]
- Quick wins that took < 1 week to implement

In exchange, I'd love to understand your current workflow and what 
your ideal solution would look like.

Worth a quick call?

[Your Name]
```

#### Variation 5: The Direct Value Exchange
```
Subject: free [process] audit?

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short. We help [industry] teams reduce [metric] by 
[percentage], and I'm offering free workflow audits to learn more 
about how different companies operate.

The audit includes:
- Analysis of your current [process]
- Benchmark against [20+ similar companies]

All I ask in return is honest feedback about what would actually 
move the needle for your team.
