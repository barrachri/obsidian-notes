# OrderLayer - WhatsApp Business OS

## Overview
**Market**: $172B contact center market but highly competitive  
**Challenge**: Saturated market with strong incumbents (Callbell, Intercom, Front)  
**Critical Issue**: Feature-focused approach vs. platform thinking  
**Recommendation**: Requires vertical specialization to be viable  

## Original Concept Issues

### Current Problems
- **Commoditized Market**: WhatsApp customer service is table stakes
- **No Clear Differentiation**: Similar to dozens of existing solutions
- **Platform Risk**: Heavy dependency on Meta/WhatsApp policies
- **Low Pricing Power**: Race to bottom on price

### Why It Fails in Current Form
- **Feature vs. Business**: WhatsApp integration is a feature, not a sustainable business
- **No Moat**: Easily replicated by existing players
- **Commoditization**: Competing against billion-dollar marketing budgets

## Strategic Pivot: WhatsApp-First ERP for Trade Businesses

### Repositioning
**From**: Generic WhatsApp customer service  
**To**: "The Complete Business Management System for UK Tradespeople"

### Why This Pivot Works
- Transforms commodity tool into industry-specific platform
- 10x higher pricing justified by complete solution
- Creates real switching costs through integrations
- UK has 35,000+ independent garages

## Beachhead Strategy (Pivoted)
**Initial Focus**: Independent MOT testing centers in Greater London

**Why This Beachhead**:
- MOT centers have recurring customer relationships
- Compliance requirements create urgency
- London shops more tech-forward
- Clear expansion to full service garages

**6-Month Beachhead Plan**:
1. **Month 1**: Build MOT reminder automation via WhatsApp
