Here are the 5 playbooks that are working well: 1. LinkedIn thought leader ads Thought leader ads on LinkedIn is delivering results, especially when combined with founder-led marketing "We've seen a 70% increase in BOFU conversions when users are exposed to Thought Leaders Ads on LinkedIn compared to BOFU conversions who were not exposed to a TOFU ad." "LinkedIn thought leader ads have been incredible performers for us - generating 300x more reach and engagement for the same budget" "The one key point that I think has given us great success with this strategy is that we typically only boost our C-suite team and they are very active and well-known in their industry." 2. AI-ready search optimization SEO has evolved. LLM-optimized content and AIO gets a lot of attention, and also results. "In the past 3 months we have seen an explosion in traffic from LLM-based search. We paced down branded spend and saw a corresponding increase in non-paid organic deals." 3. Intimate in-person events (not old school tradeshows) "We find these particularly good to help speed up deal cycles and for prospects in an open opportunity to increase the close rate. Especially for something like a more intimate event (less than 20 people) versus something massive like a tradeshow." Small, high-touch gatherings accelerate sales in ways digital can't match. 4. Strategic webinars Owned webinars featuring customers as presenters are a part of the winning recipe. • "Most significant channels in terms of growth and ROI have been website and webinars. Webinars have wide reach and recyclability with little investment." • "The most significant growth we have seen over the past year is in the usage and development of webinar programming that appeals to our clients and potential customers." • "Webinars remain our most significant channel" 5. ABM campaigns, including direct mail ABM is becoming a much bigger part of the marketing mix. "Direct mail has delivered some great results. While well known, it's underutilized in the tech space." Here one specific suggestion on how to make it work: "Have a very unique offer and hyper-targeted list (that marketing worked with the sales team on refining). Make the gift very unique/personalized and 1:1 so you can have a better gift and really think through the strategy including timing, messaging, follow-up, coordination between marketing, SDR, and AEs." Effective marketing in 2025 isn't about being everywhere, but being focused, and making proven channels work harder.
