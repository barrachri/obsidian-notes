# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## CloudWatch Intelligent Log Analyzer

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 2025  
**Author:** Product Team  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### Problem Statement
Engineering teams waste 30-60 minutes per incident manually searching through CloudWatch logs to identify root causes. Current log analysis requires deep expertise in CloudWatch Insights query language and pattern recognition across thousands of log entries.

### Solution
An AI-powered log analysis tool that proactively monitors CloudWatch logs, detects anomalies, and provides instant root cause analysis with actionable remediation steps.

### Key Benefits
- Reduce Mean Time To Detection (MTTD) from 15-30 minutes to under 2 minutes
- Reduce Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) by 70%
- Enable junior engineers to debug like senior engineers
- Catch issues before they impact customers

---

## 2. Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. **Automate log analysis** - Remove manual log searching from incident response
2. **Democratize debugging** - Enable any engineer to effectively investigate issues
3. **Proactive detection** - Identify problems before alerts fire

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Baseline | Target (6 months) | Target (1 year) |
|--------|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| MTTD | 15-30 min | < 2 min | < 1 min |
| MTTR | 45-90 min | < 20 min | < 15 min |
| False Positive Rate | N/A | < 20% | < 10% |
| Incidents Prevented | 0 | 30% | 50% |
| User Adoption | 0 | 50% of eng teams | 80% of eng teams |
| Query Cost Reduction | $0 | 20% reduction | 40% reduction |
