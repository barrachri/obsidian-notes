1. The cold start problem in SEO: When I launched, I faced the cold start problem in SEO. My "Domain Rating" (DR) was 0/100, and search engines didn't trust me. I needed to get backlinks from trusted websites Here were my some of my strategies:

- Directory listings: e.g. Crunchbase, IndieHackers - Quora: Answer questions in your field, linking to your product - Guest blogging: Write expert pieces for other blogs - Open source docs: Contribute to documentation (I got a backlink from Gatsby this way!)
1. Keyword analysis: Once I was building up my DR, I focused on showing up in search results. I invested in Ahrefs. It was costly, but worth every penny for the insights I gained.
I learned to look for keywords with low KD (keyword difficulty) and high SV (search volume). These became my targets.

2. Content, content, content: Content became my focus. With my keyword list, I created high-quality content, hand written articles. I wrote 2x 800+ word blog posts per week and landing pages around my target keywords.

I checked what was already ranking on Google for inspiration, then created better, more comprehensive versions. There's a lot of thrash on Google and often just writing a better version will get you to rank higher.
