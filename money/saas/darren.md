#104: How to Book 10 Quality Calls in 2 Weeks


Read time: 3 min

Today, I will discuss how to book 10 high quality calls in 2 weeks, even without a built MVP, a brand, or an email list.

For a long time, I was adamantly against sending emails that solicited feedback or product insights.

Why? Because 99% of the time, they’re lazy, vague, and an overall waste of time. “Can I get your thoughts?” is a shitty offer.

But then one of our clients tested a revised version we created and the results were sick. 31 calls booked in 2.5 weeks. 6 converted to paid POCs and $53K in new revenue.

We started testing the new framework out across other clients, and the results were consistently strong across most industries, ICPs, and offer types.


If I had an hour to solve a problem, I’d spend 55 minutes thinking about the problem and 5 minutes thinking about solutions.
~ Albert Einstein
We call the email the curious student framework, and it works, because it plays off something deeply human: our instinct to help.

For example. I grew up in NYC. I’ve been asked for directions more times than I can count. And no matter how busy I was, or how much of a rush I was in, I almost always stopped to help. Why? Because when someone genuinely asks for help, especially a lost vulnerable tourist (there’s a lot in NYC), we’re wired as humans to respond. This email framework taps into that human element.

You're not pitching. You're not pretending to have all the answers. You're showing up like someone looking for direction, curious, humble, and intentional. That disarms prospects. It makes them want to engage. It’s not a bait and switch tactic, it’s empathy in action.

And it’s exactly why this approach consistently drives replies, trust, and booked calls.

Let’s take a look.

Step 1: Build a short list of targets
Search LinkedIn by title + company size (i.e., “Head of Growth” at Series A SaaS companies)

Scrape or filter on Apollo, Clay, or SalesNav

Look through recent YC, a16z, or Techstars cohorts

Use Crunchbase or AngelList to find funded startups in your vertical

Search Twitter/X bios for functional keywords (“ops nerd,” “B2B growth”)

Skim podcast guest lists or conference speakers in your niche

Aim for a list of 75-100 qualified targets where you can write with clarity and context. You don’t need thousands of leads, you need the right 100 people


Step 2: Send the first email

Subject: need help

First Name,

I’m (Your Name], I’m the CEO and Co-Founder of (your company name), and I recently (brief credibility statement, graduated from X, built Y, raised funding from Z, etc.].

I’m reaching out because I’m deeply interested in (industry] and where (your expertise] can have the biggest impact. I’m looking to connect with high level leaders who see the potential of (your solution) but may not know where to start.

I’d love to learn how your team operates and see if I can develop some (custom insights/solutions) to make your life easier, completely free.

I know this is a bit of a strange ask, I'm basically offering to come in as a (free consultant / research partner)  in exchange for learning more about the challenges you face.

Would love to chat if this sounds interesting, or if you could point me in the right direction. At the very least, I’d be happy to share a few (case studies/examples] of what’s possible with today’s (technology/strategy].

Best,
(Your Name]


Step 3: Follow up with underdog energy
Wait 4, 5 days. If they haven’t replied, send this:



Subject: (same thread as email 1)

First Name,

Wanted to follow up. I know you probably get a bunch of emails like this, but here’s why this one’s different:

After studying CS at Stanford (example) and working on ML infrastructure at Brex (example), I kept running into the same problem: no matter how much automation we built, (whatever the big bottleneck was).

None of my peers coming out of schools like Stanford, MIT, or Harvard were focused on fixing the most painful, unsexy part of (industry your targeting), things like (examples of the most mundane boring part)

I really want to change that.

So I started (your company name) We’re building (this, by solving this)

I have nothing to pitch you. I’m just trying to learn how top (whatever industry/vertical) teams operate and see if we can build something genuinely useful.

Would you be open to a quick call to help?

No pitch, just a conversation.

Best,
(Your Name]

Step 4: Book the call fast
As soon as someone shows interest, send your calendar link immediately. Make it dead simple to say yes.

Step 5: Metrics
If your targeting is tight and messaging is value-driven, you should expect:

50–60% open rate (if you’re sending from a warm domain and using clean subject lines)

10–20% reply rate (personalization and clarity matter most here)

6–10 booked calls per 100 emails (depends on your ICP and how sharp your CTA is)

The real magic happens in the follow up. A single nudge can double your replies.


Here’s what you’ll learn:
The real problems your target market is dealing with.

Language they use to describe pain.

Gaps in current solutions.

Signals of urgency and willingness to pay.

What a “must-have” offer could look like.

If you educate them correctly, and there is a need, they will convert.


That’s it for today folks.


See you all next week!

How we take founders from zero to $1 million in ARR

Title: How We Take Founders from 0 - $1M in ARR


Read time: 3.5 min


Today, I will discuss the three-step process we use to help clients reach 1 Million in ARR as quickly as possible.

The goal of our engagements is to do two things. (1) validate the hypothesis of what it is we built with our minimum viable product (MVP) and (2) find indications of product market fit (PMF) by actively asking people to buy your product. The byproduct of executing these two things will lead to finding indications or PMF and scaling to 1 million in ARR.

Achieving these outcomes is not about setting goals. It’s about building systems. The systems will help you achieve your objectives. This issue is designed to help you understand this system.


Risk comes from not knowing what you’re doing.
