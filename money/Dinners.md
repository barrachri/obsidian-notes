Putting together a small off-the-record private dinner for 12-15 people later this month. If you run a real estate fund - dm me. It’s an incredible group - and I thought it’d be fun to add a couple more folks via a post.


Ive got a few seats open for an event tomorrow afternoon in SF for founders. Great if you’re willing spend a Friday afternoon being social and talking shop. hmu on dm if you’re interested.
