## Traffic-Sensitivity Table (no franchise royalties)

| Daily tickets | Annual revenue (€) | CoGS 21 % (€) | Card fees 1.2 % (€) | Contribution after variable costs (€) | **Fixed costs (€)** | **EBITDA (€)** | EBITDA margin |

*Fixed costs = payroll (€ 93 k) + rent (€ 42 k) + overhead (€ 18 k). EBITDA rounded to nearest € 100.*

## Sanity Check
- Payroll ≈ 25 % of sales at 100 tickets; 19 % at 150 tickets → within café norms.
- Rent 11 % of sales at 100 tickets; drops below 9 % once traffic ≥ 120 tickets.
- Breakeven ≈ 80 tickets/day given current fixed-cost base.

## Open Questions
1. Confirm target average ticket (currently modelling € 6.80).
2. Tighten rent benchmark once short-listed properties emerge.
3. Refine CAPEX: front-of-house vs. back-of-house breakdown.
4. Choose POS / loyalty stack (cost & integration timeline).
5. Outline marketing plan for first 90 days (grand opening, influencers, etc.).
