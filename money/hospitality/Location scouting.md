# The Ultimate Location Scouting Checklist

  

A great location is a non-negotiable success factor. This checklist is designed to guide the selection process for both high-end pizzeria and specialty coffee shop concepts.

  

### Phase 1: Macro Analysis (The Neighborhood)

  

* **[Both] Dominant Population:** Is the area driven by residents, office workers, or tourists?

* **[Coffee]:** Thrives on high-density office workers and daily commuters.

* **[Pizza]:** Thrives on dense residential areas for dinner and delivery. An ideal location has a mix of both.

* **[Both] Anchor Institutions:** Is it near a major traffic driver like a university, hospital, transport hub, or large corporate campus?

* **[Both] Income Level:** Do the area's average income and spending habits align with a premium pizza/specialty coffee price point?

* **[Pizza] Evening & Weekend Economy:** Is the neighborhood active after 6 PM and on weekends? Look for bars, theaters, and active nightlife.

* **[Both] Safety & Ambiance:** Is the area clean, well-lit, and perceived as safe?

  

### Phase 2: Micro Analysis (The Street & Block)

  

* **[Both] Foot Traffic Count (CRITICAL):**

* Physically count passersby on different days (Tuesday vs. Saturday) and at different times (8 AM, 1 PM, 7 PM).

* **[Coffee]:** Target: 2,000+ people walking past the door per day. Morning rush (8-10 AM) is key.

* **[Pizza]:** Lunch and dinner rushes are key. Observe foot traffic patterns around meal times.

* **[Both] Visibility & Frontage:**

* Is it a corner location? (*Ideal for visibility*).

* How much street frontage does it have? Are there large windows?

* Is it easily seen from 50 meters away? Are there obstructions like trees or bus stops?

* **[Both] Co-Tenancy:** What are the immediate neighboring businesses?

* **Good:** Boutiques, bookstores, gyms, cinemas, high-end grocery stores.

* **Bad:** Direct competitors, vacant storefronts, low-end retail.

* **[Pizza] Vehicle & Delivery Access:**

* Is there short-term parking for customer pickup?

* Is there easy, safe access for delivery drivers (UberEats, etc.) that doesn't block traffic?

  

### Phase 3: Competitive Analysis

  

* **[Both] Direct Competitors:** Map out every specialty coffee shop or Neapolitan-style pizzeria within a 500m radius. Are they thriving or struggling?

* **[Both] Indirect Competitors:** Identify the Starbucks, Domino's, and other large chains. Their presence proves a market exists, but you must differentiate with quality.

* **[Both] Quality Gap:** Is there an unmet demand for high-quality coffee or pizza in the area? Can you be the clear *best-in-class* option?

  

### Phase 4: Physical Site & Technical Requirements

  

* **[Pizza] Ventilation (NON-NEGOTIABLE):** Can you install a commercial-grade kitchen hood that vents to the roof? Check building plans and local regulations *before* signing anything.

* **[Both] Utilities:**

* **[Pizza]:** Does the site have access to a high-capacity gas line and 3-phase electrical power for the oven?

* **[Coffee]:** Does it have the plumbing and electrical capacity for a commercial espresso machine and ice maker?

* **[Both] Size & Layout:** Does the space (20-60 sqm) have a functional, efficient layout? Avoid long, narrow spaces or awkward angles.

* **[Pizza] Outdoor Seating:** Is there space for a patio or sidewalk seating? This can dramatically increase revenue in warmer months.

* **[Both] History:** What was the previous business, and why did it leave? High turnover is a major red flag.

  

### Phase 5: Lease & Financials

  

* **[Both] Rent-to-Revenue Ratio:** Based on your financial projections, will the annual rent be less than 10% of your projected gross revenue? (Slightly higher, up to 12-14%, may be acceptable for an absolute A+ pizzeria location).

* **[Both] Lease Terms:** Negotiate for a tenant improvement allowance, a 5+5 year lease term (5-year initial with an option to renew for 5), and an exclusivity clause that prevents the landlord from leasing to a direct competitor.
