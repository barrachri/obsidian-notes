# Real Estate Investment Strategy

## Overview
Conservative approach focusing on all-cash acquisitions followed by post-stabilization refinancing to return investor capital while maintaining cash flow.

## Capital Deployment Strategy

### Core Philosophy
- **Acquire all cash** - Eliminates financing risk during acquisition
- **Renovate all cash** - Maintains control during vulnerable renovation period  
- **Refinance after stabilization** - Extract capital once rents are optimized
- **Avoid bridge loans** - Too expensive and add fragility during already fragile periods

## Key Financial Metrics

### Loan-to-Value (LTV)
- **Theoretical Maximum**: 75% for commercial apartments (5+ units)
- **Practical Reality**: Often closer to 65% due to DSCR constraints
- **Impact**: Forces higher equity contributions than initially expected

### Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)
- **Minimum Required**: 1.2 to 1.25
- **Calculation**: Net Operating Income (NOI) ÷ Annual Debt Service
- **Example**: £100,000 annual debt requires £120,000-£125,000 NOI

## The Over-Equitization Challenge

### Why DSCR Constrains Leverage
While 75% LTV seems achievable theoretically, DSCR requirements often act as the limiting factor. In high interest rate environments or when property prices haven't adjusted downward, NOI may be insufficient to support the debt service from a 75% LTV loan while meeting DSCR requirements.

### Real-World Impact
- **Los Angeles Market**: Actual achievable LTV closer to 65% vs theoretical 75%
- **Result**: Borrowers forced to contribute more equity than anticipated
- **Benefit**: Creates safety cushion for market downturns

## Case Study: Moses Kagan's First Deal

### The Transaction
- **Property**: 16-unit building, East Los Angeles
- **Equity Contribution**: ~35% of purchase price
- **Lender**: Conservative bank requiring over-equitization
- **Outcome**: Survived Global Financial Crisis due to equity cushion

### Key Lessons
1. Conservative lending proved beneficial during market stress
2. Higher equity contributions create resilience
3. "Unpleasant for a little while" but ultimately protective

## Strategic Reflections

### Historical Approach
Kagan's preference for conservative leverage has proven wise, though he reflects that even more conservative cash-out refinances would have been beneficial given recent interest rate increases.

### Current Market Considerations
- Long-term, fixed-rate loans provide stability
- Recent interest rate regime makes refinancing "pretty painful"
- Importance of sufficient equity cushion to absorb market changes

## Implementation Framework

### Phase 1: Acquisition
- Source deals suitable for all-cash purchase
- Ensure renovation budget available in cash

### Phase 2: Value-Add
- Complete renovations without debt
- Stabilize occupancy and rents

### Phase 3: Refinancing
- Execute cash-out refinance on stabilized asset
- Return capital to investors while maintaining cash flow
- Create "cash machine" for ongoing returns
