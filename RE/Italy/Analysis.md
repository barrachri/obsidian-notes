# Italy Real Estate Investment Analysis

## Executive Summary
Focus on Monza-Bergamo corridor buy-to-rent strategy targeting commuter properties with 30-minute rail access to Milan. Conservative approach emphasizing stable cash flow over high-yield, high-maintenance alternatives.

## Portugal Strategy Reference
**Current Plan Status**: Solid foundation targeting commuter-led T2s with light capex, maintaining all-in basis <€3,700/m² and DSCR >1.2. Postpones high-touch plays until operations and cash buffers mature. Uses SGPS-Lda structure for tax optimization.

**Recommended Adjustment**: Increase vacancy/repairs reserve to €120/month as supply loosens post-Golden-Visa changes.

## Monza-Bergamo Buy-to-Rent Strategy

### Phase 1: Starter Deal (0 → 1)

#### Target Property Specifications
| Criteria | Specification | Rationale |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| **Unit Type** | Bilocale 60-75 m², APE ≥ C | Liquid resale market, single-tenant simplicity |
| **Location** | ≤800m from rail stop (MI-BG or MI-MB line) | 30-minute commute to Milan drives rental demand |
| **Price Cap** | ≤€190k purchase price | Keeps all-in cost <€205k, maintains net yield ≥5% |
| **Renovation** | €9-11k: paint, SPC flooring, IKEA Metod fronts, LED, split A/C | Adds €80-120 monthly rent premium |
| **Financing** | 25-year fixed, 80% LTV → €152k loan | €780 P&I @ 4%, DSCR ≈ 1.25 |
| **Target Rent** | €1,000-1,050 unfurnished (ISTAT+2% clause) | €110-150 monthly cushion after IMU/condo fees |

**5-Year Projection**: €7-9k cash flow + €17k principal paydown

### Phase 2: Scaling Strategy

#### Deal Progression

2. **Deal #3**: Trilocale 85m² in Bergamo Alta fringe
   - Investment: €220k + €15k furnishing
   - Strategy: Winter long-let / summer mid-term tourist rental

### Alternative Strategies (Currently Postponed)

| Strategy | Gross Yield | Key Drawbacks |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Student Room-lets** (PoliMi/Pavia) | 7-8% | €12k furnishing cost, frequent turnover |
| **Managed Short-stay** (Fiera/Expo) | ~5% net (60% occupancy, 20% mgmt) | License caps, seasonality risk |
| **Self-managed Airbnb** (Lakes) | ~6% net | High operational workload |
