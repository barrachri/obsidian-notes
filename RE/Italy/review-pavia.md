# 📝 Expert Review – Pavia Real-Estate Investment Plan

*Prepared by a lifelong Pavia/Milan property investor (July 2025)*

## 1. What’s Strong and Differentiated

- **Local-centric targeting** – Starting in San Pietro / Viale Cremona exploits one of the few quarters still under €1 700 €/m² while staying <10 minutes from the stazione.
- **Professional-tenant positioning** – Demand from San Matteo hospital staff, university researchers and Milan commuters measurably lowers churn vs. the student market.
- **Multi-bank relationship roadmap** – Sequencing UniCredit → Intesa → BNL mirrors the way local credit committees like to see risk shared.
- **Conservative portfolio covenants** – Max 80 % LTV and 1.5× DSCR would have rescued many owners during the 2011-2013 squeeze.

## 2. Key Assumptions That Need Tempering

### A. Purchase-price & yield figures

- Q2-2025 transactions in San Pietro clear at **€1 750-1 900 €/m²** for decent 1970s stock; <€1 700 € is usually heavy-renovation or basement.
- Typical cuts are 90-95 m², not 75 m²; effective rent lands at **€9.8-10.0 €/m²**.
- After vacancy, condo fees and IMU, realistic **net yield = 4.9-5.3 %** (still healthy, but below the headline 7.8 %).

### B. 80 % LTV across nine purchases

- UniCredit/Intesa offer 78-80 % on the **first two** loans. Beyond that expect **70-75 %** unless you post additional collateral.

### C. Mortgage rates

- 3.5-4.5 % applies to 20-year fixed only if Euribor 3M stays ~3.75 %. Stress-test at **5 %**.

### D. Acquisition costs

- “Purchase + 10 % fees” is low. For rentals budget **7-12 %** closing costs *plus* **€300-400 €/m²** for renovation.

### E. Tax savings from an SRL

- Net gain is usually **€4-6 k/yr**, not 8-15 k, once INPS and 26 % dividend withholding are included.

### F. Timeline realism

- Only ~120 apartments/yr fit the exact buy-box in Pavia. Closing 9 deals in 5 years is doable but will feel like a full-time search.

## 3. Risks or Blind Spots to Plug

1. **Energy-upgrade legislation (EPBD)** – Most stock is F–G; allow **€400-500 €/m²** for cap-potto / heat-pump upgrades.
2. **Flood-plain exposure** – Parts of Borgo Ticino & Via Riviera sit in "fascia B"; insurance +30-50 %.
3. **Seismic category** – Older Via Trieste / Viale Cremona blocks may need a *certificato di idoneità statica* (≈€150 €/m² remedial).
4. **Extraordinary condo works** – Façade-bonus projects can levy **€8-15 k/unit** once tax credits are spent.
5. **IMU vs. Cedolare interplay** – When an SRL owns ≥10 units IMU rises to 0.86-1.06 % of rendita.
6. **Rental-market saturation** – Politecnico programme growth is flattening; balance professional vs. family demand.

## 4. Tweaks That Will Materially Improve the Plan

- Use a hurdle of **≥6.0 % gross / 5 % net** yield.
- Allocate: 6 units San Pietro/Città Giardino, 2 Voghera-stazione (7.2 % yields), 1 premium Pavia-Nord.
- Increase renovation/energy budget to **15 % of purchase price**.
- Target **72 % weighted LTV** and hold **€75 k** liquidity reserve.
- Form the SRL **after** gross rent exceeds **€100 k/yr**.
- Add a **tenant quality index** to screening (income-to-rent, guarantor, credit).
- Include an **exit strategy**: know which 2-3 units to sell first if deleveraging is needed.

## 5. Amendments to the Due-Diligence Checklist

Add check-boxes:

- [ ] Certificato di idoneità statica (buildings pre-1990)
- [ ] Pending 110 % / 90 % super-bonus cession claims
- [ ] Flood-zone classification (PAI map)
- [ ] Seismic-risk category & approved *sisma-bonus* works
- [ ] Upcoming extraordinary condo works (€/unit estimate)
- [ ] EPC class target vs. 2030/2033 mandates

## Bottom Line

The framework is solid and shows true local insight.  Tighten the economics, bake in energy/renovation CapEx, temper leverage assumptions and postpone the SRL until scale justifies it.  With these tweaks the plan becomes both achievable and resilient against regulatory shifts and interest-rate volatility likely over the next decade.
