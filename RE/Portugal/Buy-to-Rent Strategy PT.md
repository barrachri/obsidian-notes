- EU residency simplifies property purchases
- Geographic diversification while staying in Euro

## Risk Management

### Portfolio Diversification

- Different tenant profiles (professionals vs families)
- Stagger purchase timing

### Operational Considerations

- Keep 6 months operating expenses in reserve
- Consider professional property management for 3+ units
- Standardize fixtures/finishes for easier maintenance

## Key Action Items

1. **Mortgage Pre-approval**: Secure 35-year financing for maximum flexibility
2. **Property Search**: Focus on Almada town center, walking distance to ferry
3. **Renovation Team**: Identify contractors for bulk pricing across properties
4. **Tax Planning**: Consult specialist on Category F vs Category B treatment
5. **Italy Research**: Begin researching Italian markets for future expansion

## Critical Success Factors

- **Location**: Proximity to Cacilhas ferry terminal essential
- **Condition**: Target properties with cosmetic issues only
- **Timing**: Balance renovation completion with rental market demand
- **Management**: Develop systems for multiple property oversight
- **Financial**: Maintain conservative debt-to-income ratios for stability

## Almada/Seixal Buy-to-Rent Playbook  

### 1. Starter Deal (0 → 1)  
| Target | Spec | Rationale |
|--------|------|-----------|
| Unit   | T2, 65-80 m², EPC ≥ C | Easiest to rent, light rehab only |
| Location | ≤600 m Cacilhas/Seixal ferry/train | Commute demand drives rents |
| Price cap | ≤ €230 k (purchase only) | Keeps all-in < €245 k and net ≥ 5 % |
| Rehab | €10-12 k paint, LVT floor, IKEA kitchen fronts, LED, split A/C | Adds €100-150 rent premium |
| Financing | 35-yr fixed, 80 % LTV → €184 k | €790 P&I @ 3.8 %; DSCR ≈ 1.25 |
| Rent | €1 000–1 050 unfurnished (CPI+3 % clause) | €110–160 monthly cushion after IMI/condo |

6-year outlook: ≈€8-10 k cumulative net cash + €20 k principal paid.

---

### 2. Scaling Path  
1. **Deal #2** – Clone T2 in Seixal-Baía; use equity release once DSCR ≥ 1.3.  
2. **Deal #3** – T3 90 m² Caparica beach (€240 k + €15 k furnish); mix long-let winter / mid-term summer to hedge ferry-corridor risk.

---

### 3. Alternatives & Why Postpone  
| Strategy | Gross Yield | Key Drawbacks |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| T3/T4 room-let | 7-8 % | €15-18 k furnish, SCIE fire licence, multiple contracts, high turnover |
| Managed Airbnb (Almada/Caparica) | ~5 % net after 65 % occ., 25 % mgmt, 6 % VAT | Seasonality, licence caps, admin burden |
| Self-managed Airbnb | ~6 % net (+€300/mo vs long-let) | 24 h guest ops, cleaning logistics |

Focus on standard lets until systems & cash reserve are solid; add one T4 room-rental later for upside.

---

### 4. Corporate Structure for Tax Efficiency  
```
You           SGPS (holding) ──100%──▶ Prop-Lda (Portugal) ──owns──▶ Properties
                                     │
                                     └─charges mgmt fee/claims interest & 2 % dep.
```
• Bank lends to Prop-Lda (you guarantee) at ≤80 % LTV; SGPS injects equity via shareholder loan.  
• SGPS = no VAT, dividends/capital gains exempt (participation-exemption).  
• Prop-Lda taxed 17 % CIT first €50 k, 21 % above; interest & depreciation deductible.  
• Extra cost: accountant + IES ≈ €1 k/yr—worth it from 2+ units.  
• EU expansion: SGPS forms Italian SRL; dividends upstream 0 % WHT via EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive.

---

### 5. Financing Sources Open to SPV-Lda  
• Millennium BCP – Crédito Imobiliário Empresas  
• Santander Totta – Imobiliário Profissional  
• BPI – Crédito PME Imobiliário  
• Novo Banco – Crédito Investimento Imobiliário  

All fund ≤80 % LTV if you sign personal guarantee and SGPS provides equity.

---

### 6. Key Metrics Cheat-Sheet  
• IMI: 0.34–0.45 % of tax value  
• Transaction costs: ~7–8 % (IMT + IS + notary)  
• Vacancy/repairs reserve: €50–100/mo per unit  
• Early principal pre-payment fee: 0.5 % (fixed-rate loans)  

Stay under these thresholds and the portfolio should deliver ≥5 % net yield with manageable risk.

# Portugal Rental Portfolio – Corporate vs Personal Ownership

## 1. Structures

| Option | Legal Vehicle | Bank Loan | Main Tax Regime | Key Pros | Key Cons |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| **Personal title** | None (Category F) | Mortgage in your name | 28 % flat on gross rent (few deductions) | Simple, no setup cost | Mortgage interest **not deductible**; gains taxed up to 48 % |
| **Prop-Lda owned by SGPS** | SGPS (holding) → Prop-Lda (operating) | Loan to Prop-Lda, you guarantee | CIT 17 % ≤ €50 k, 21 % above. Interest, depreciation, repairs deductible | Offsets interest; easier scaling; dividends/gains inside group exempt | Setup ≈ €1 k; accountant + IES ≈ €1 k/yr; IMT still due on >75 % share sale |

```
You          SGPS (holding) ──100 %──▶ Prop-Lda ──▶ Properties
               ▲  dividends 0 % WHT        │
               └──────── shareholder loan (equity)
```

## 2. Three-Unit Illustrative Cash Flow (3× T2 @ €220 k, rent €1 100)

| Item | Personal | Prop-Lda |
|------|----------|----------|
| Annual gross rent | €39 600 | €39 600 |
| Deductibles | n/a | €20 k interest + €4.5 k depreciation + €7.5 k repairs |
| Taxable base | €39 600 | €27 600 |
| Tax | 28 % = €11 088 | 17 % = €4 692 |
| Net cash (add back deprec.) | €28 512 | €27 408 |
| Accountant cost | – | −€1 000 |
| **Net to owner** | **€28 512** | **€26 408** *(+ interest offset saves ≈€5–6 k)* |

Break-even ~2 units; savings grow with higher interest or portfolio size.

## 3. Capital-Gain Exit (single flat, €300 k gain)

| Personal | Prop-Lda |
|----------|----------|
| 50 % included → €150 k × 48 % = **€72 k** (or 28 % flat = €84 k) | 17 % on first €50 k + 21 % on next €250 k = **€61 k**; dividend WHT 28 % on distribution |

IMT applies if buyer acquires ≥75 % of shares in a real-estate-heavy company.

## 4. Refinance vs Sale

• **Refinance** inside Prop-Lda taps equity tax-free, interest remains deductible.  
• **Sale** triggers CGT & IMT (direct) or share-deal tax (indirect).

## 5. When to Use Corporate Structure

1. Portfolio ≥ 3 units or annual interest > €15 k.  
2. Plan to recycle equity via refinancing.  
3. Need clean SPV for bank or future investor entry.

Otherwise, personal ownership with a separate management Lda (invoicing a market-rate fee) may suffice.
```

Strengths  
• Targets an undervalued, supply-constrained sub-market with direct Lisbon access; 5-7 % gross is realistic today for well-located T2/T3 units.  
• “Easy-fix” focus keeps cap-ex low and renovation licensing simple (no Camara structural permit, often no condo approval).  
• 35-year mortgage maximises cash flow; most banks still grant 80-90 % LTV to EU residents if DTI < 40 %.  

Gaps / watch-outs  
1. Financing – rate swing: fixed 40-year quotes now 3.5-3.8 % vs 1.5 % in 2021; stress test yields at 4 %.  
2. Taxes – IMI (0.34-0.45 %) and AIMI (wealth tax) missing from return calc; NHR ends after 10 yrs and is being phased out for new arrivals.  
3. Category B bookkeeping costs ±€1 k/yr; only worth it if interest + depreciation > that fee.  
4. Mais Habitação laws cap annual rent increases on pre-2023 leases (≈ 2 %); build rent-review clauses or furnish for turnover.  
5. Room-rental T4: require ASA fire-safety sign-off and multiple tenancy contracts; vacancy risk if >2 rooms empty.  
6. Energy Certificate ≥ C mandatory for 2030 leases; budget windows/insulation.  
7. Market cycle: pipeline of new builds in Cacilhas/Pragal completing 2026 could soften rents; diversify into Caparica beachfront or Almada Velha to hedge.  

Action tweaks  
• Model 75 % LTV, 3.8 % rate, 20 % vacancy/maintenance to ensure net 4 % still holds.  
• Add IMI + condo fees to pro-forma.  
• Pre-negotiate line-of-credit with bank for “obra” so you can close fast and refurbish later.  
• For Italy phase, open Portuguese SGPS holding company now to recycle gains tax-efficiently later.
