### 3. Alternatives & Why Postpone

|Strategy|Gross Yield|Key Drawbacks|
|---|---|---|
|T3/T4 room-let|7-8 %|€15-18 k furnish, SCIE fire licence, multiple contracts, high turnover|
|Managed Airbnb (Almada/Caparica)|~5 % net after 65 % occ., 25 % mgmt, 6 % VAT|Seasonality, licence caps, admin burden|
|Self-managed Airbnb|~6 % net (+€300/mo vs long-let)|24 h guest ops, cleaning logistics|

Focus on standard lets until systems & cash reserve are solid; add one T4 room-rental later for upside.

### 4. Corporate Structure for Tax Efficiency

```
You           SGPS (holding) ──100%──▶ Prop-Lda (Portugal) ──owns──▶ Properties
                                     │

• SGPS = no VAT, dividends/capital gains exempt (participation-exemption).  
• Prop-Lda taxed 17 % CIT first €50 k, 21 % above; interest & depreciation deductible.  
• Extra cost: accountant + IES ≈ €1 k/yr—worth it from 2+ units.  
• EU expansion: SGPS forms Italian SRL; dividends upstream 0 % WHT via EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive.

### 6. Key Metrics Cheat-Sheet

• IMI: 0.34–0.45 % of tax value  
• Transaction costs: ~7–8 % (IMT + IS + notary)  
• Vacancy/repairs reserve: €50–100/mo per unit  
• Early principal pre-payment fee: 0.5 % (fixed-rate loans)

Stay under these thresholds and the portfolio should deliver ≥5 % net yield with manageable risk.
