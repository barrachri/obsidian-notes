| Zone | Buy €/m² | Rent €/m² | Yield | Growth | Notes |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Marvila T2 80 m² | 3 500–4 500 | 14–16 | ~4.5 % | 6–8 % p.a. | Rehab costs, gentrification risk |
| Marvila T3 100 m² | 3 300–4 200 | 14–17 | ~4.7 % | 6–8 % | |
| Almada T2 70 m² | 2 500–3 200 | 12–14 | ~5 % | 5 % | Steady cash flow |

## Rental Benchmark (Almada)  
T1 bay-view, no garage: fair €920–1 000/mo; current €1 123 is 12–20 % above market.

## Acquisition Strategy  
1. Bid ≈10 % below ask (15 % if listing >90 days or needs rehab).  
2. Sequence 3 purchases over 9–12 mo; keep LTV ≤70 %.  
3. Target order: rehabbed Marvila T2/T3 → cash-flow Almada T2 → value-add Almada T3.  
4. Attach mortgage pre-approval + 15-day due-diligence clause (cancel/renegotiate on issues).

## Unit-Selection Tips  
- Exposure: south/west for max light & rent premium.  
- Outdoor space: balcony/terrace ≥6 m² adds ~7 % value; essential above 3rd floor.  
- Size sweet-spots: T2 70–90 m², T3 90–110 m² (efficient layouts).  
- Construction year: prefer post-2000; pre-2000 only if a full structural/MEP renovation completed 2014 +.  
- Lift: buildings ≥4 floors should have one; absence cuts value ~10 %.  
- Energy class: A/B for lower operating costs and higher yields.

## Verifying Renovation (pre-2000 stock)  
- Request seller’s renovation permit number & invoices.  
- Check municipal records for permit issuance date.  
- Confirm dates in Habitation license & energy certificate.  
- Review HOA minutes for major works completion.  
- Obtain engineer’s inspection report to verify scope.
