# Portugal Real Estate Investment Metrics

## Overview
Key performance indicators and financial benchmarks for Portuguese real estate investments, focusing on sustainable cash flow and conservative leverage.

## Core Performance Metrics

### Return on Capital (ROC)
**Primary Target**: ≥5% NOI/total all-in cost  
**Stretch Goal**: 6%+ for refurbishment projects

#### ROC Calculation
```
ROC = NOI ÷ Total All-In Cost
```

**Where:**
- **NOI** = Net Operating Income
- **Total All-In Cost** = Purchase price + closing costs + rehabilitation costs

### Net Operating Income (NOI)

#### NOI Formula
```
NOI = Gross Annual Rent - Operating Expenses
```

#### Operating Expenses Include:
- **Condominium fees**
- **IMI** (Municipal Property Tax)
- **Insurance premiums**
- **Vacancy/repairs reserve**

## Target Benchmarks by Property Type

### T2 Properties (Lisbon/Commuter Belt)
- **Minimum ROC**: 5%
- **Example**: €200k all-in cost → NOI ≥€10k/year required
- **Post-Debt Service**: ~€7k annual cash flow
- **Target DSCR**: ≈1.2

### T3 Properties & Major Refurbs
- **Minimum ROC**: 6%+
- **Rationale**: Offset larger equity requirements and interest rate risk
- **Higher threshold**: Compensates for increased complexity and capital tie-up

## Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR)

### Target DSCR
**Minimum**: 1.2x  
**Calculation**: NOI ÷ Annual Debt Service

#### DSCR Implications
- **1.2x**: Conservative baseline for lender approval
- **>1.3x**: Preferred for scaling additional acquisitions
- **Buffer**: Protects against interest rate increases and vacancy

## Investment Thresholds

### Deal Qualification Criteria
| Metric | Minimum | Preferred | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **ROC** | 5% | 6%+ | Higher for refurbs/T3s |
| **DSCR** | 1.2x | 1.3x+ | Required for scaling |
| **All-in Cost/m²** | - | <€3,700 | Market-dependent ceiling |

### Risk Buffers
- **Vacancy Reserve**: Factor 1-2 months annually
- **Repairs Reserve**: €100-120/month ongoing
- **Interest Rate Buffer**: DSCR cushion for rate increases

## Practical Application

### Deal Evaluation Process
1. **Calculate Total All-In Cost**
   - Purchase price + closing costs (~8-10%) + rehab budget
2. **Estimate NOI**
   - Market rent - operating expenses
3. **Verify ROC Target**
   - NOI ÷ All-in cost ≥ 5% (6% for refurbs)
4. **Confirm DSCR**
   - NOI ÷ projected debt service ≥ 1.2x

### Example Calculation: T2 Property
```
Purchase Price: €180,000
Closing Costs: €16,200 (9%)
Rehab Budget: €8,000
Total All-In: €204,200

Market Rent: €1,100/month = €13,200/year
Operating Expenses: €3,000/year
NOI: €10,200

ROC: €10,200 ÷ €204,200 = 5.0% ✓
```

## Market-Specific Considerations

### Lisbon Commuter Belt
- **Focus**: T2 properties with rail connectivity
- **Target**: Light capex, stable tenant profile
- **Benchmark**: All-in basis <€3,700/m²

### Post-Golden Visa Environment
- **Adjustment**: Increased vacancy/repairs reserve to €120/month
- **Reason**: Supply loosening may impact rental stability
- **Strategy**: Maintain conservative underwriting standards

## Performance Monitoring

### Quarterly Review Metrics
- **Actual vs. Projected NOI**
- **Vacancy rates vs. reserve assumptions**
- **Maintenance costs vs. budget**
- **DSCR performance on leveraged properties**

### Annual Portfolio Assessment
- **Weighted average ROC across portfolio**
- **Debt service coverage trends**
- **Market rent growth vs. projections**
- **Capital appreciation vs. cash flow contribution**
