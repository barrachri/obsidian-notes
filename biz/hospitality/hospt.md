# Real-Estate Ownership Strategy for Milan Micro-F&B ("McDonald’s Model")

A decision framework on whether to buy the premises and let the pizzeria/coffee-bar pay the mortgage.

---
## 1  How the McDonald’s Model Works

1. **Hold real estate** (buy or master-lease long term).
2. **Sub-lease to operating entity** at a markup.
3. Rental stream services debt and creates a second profit layer.

Key: predictable sales, long occupancy horizon, cheap long-tenor financing.

## 2  Milan Cost & Funding Snapshot (2025)

| Item | Figure |
|---|---|
| Unit size | 35 sqm street-level (Brera/Porta Venezia) |
| Purchase price | **€12 k–€14 k/m² → ≈ €450 k** |
| Market rent | **€900–€1 000/m²/yr → €2 800–€3 000 mo** |
| Gross yield | **≈ 6.5 %** |
| Bank LTV | 60–70 %, 10-yr amortising, 4.0–4.5 % int. |
| Debt service (70 % LTV) | **≈ €3 100 mo** |
| Equity cheque | **≈ €150 k** (same size as fit-out budget) |

Debt service ≈ market rent ⇒ ownership doesn’t boost near-term cash flow.

## 3  Cash-Flow Comparison (Pizzeria Example)

|   | **Lease** | **Own** |
|---|---|---|
| Sales (ex-VAT) | €514 k | €514 k |
| Rent | €30 k | — |
| Debt service | — | €37 k |
| Maint. + RE tax | — | €4 k |
| **OpCo EBITDA** | €146 k | €143 k |
| Property SPV cash | — | +€3 k |
| **Total owner cash** | **€146 k** | **€146 k** |

Ownership reallocates—not increases—year-one cash.

## 4  Pros & Cons

**Pros**
• Long-term wealth once mortgage paid (asset ≥ €600 k).  
• Downside hedge—premises can be re-let or sold.  
• Leverage on property appreciation (1.5–2 % real p.a.).

**Cons**
• Ties up equity better used for new units (store IRR 35–45 % vs property 6–9 %).  
• Cash strain: Italian banks rarely >10–12 yr terms under €1 m.  
• Extra friction: 10 % transaction/ notary fees, slower deals.

## 5  When Ownership Makes Sense

1. Concept proven (≥ 2 profitable stores).  
2. Patient capital comfortable with blended return.  
3. Site uniquely strategic or extraction shaft in place.  
4. Vendor financing, call option, or ≥ 15-year amortisation keeping debt service ≤ 75 % of market rent.

---
## 6  Hybrid Alternatives

• **Lease-with-purchase option** after 3–5 yrs.  
• **PropCo JV** with retail RE fund; you sign 12-yr lease + profit share.  
• **Crowdfunded SPV** (Walliance, Concrete) to lower cost of capital.

## 7  Recommended Path for First Milan Unit

1. Take a prime **lease**, prove the model.  
2. Secure a **call option** on the property.  
3. Deploy freed €150 k equity into a **second leased unit**.  
4. Adopt PropCo-OpCo ownership after three cash-cow stores and 2.5× mortgage coverage ratio.

**Bottom line:** Buying the real estate is a powerful long-term play but usually comes **after** operational proof unless you lock exceptionally cheap, long-tenor financing or a vendor-friendly deal.
