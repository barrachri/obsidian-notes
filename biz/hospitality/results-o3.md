## 1  Top-Line Drivers

**Daily covers vs. seats**  
• Model uses ~20 seats turning 3.5 / 4.5 / 5.5× day.  
  – 3.5× is reachable.  
  – 4.5× is ambitious; weekday lunch will drag this down—track wait-time KPIs.  
  – 5.5× (110+ covers) only if you operate 11:30-23:30 with <45 min dwell.

**Average order value (AOV)**  
€18 / €20 / €22 incl. VAT is credible in Lisbon prime; watch cheese & flour inflation (+7 % YoY).

**Alcohol mix**  
Bad-case shows 30 % of guests ordering wine—real shops see 40 %+. Upsell opportunity.

---
## 2  Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

• 32 % → 30 % → 28 % ok *if* mozzarella is portion-controlled and dough+tomato stay <8 % of sales.  
• Clarify if beverage COGS are inside “Food Costs”; margins look tight if they are.

## 3  Labour

| Scenario | Current €/mo | FTE | €/FTE/mo | Comment |
|----------|--------------|-----|-----------|---------|
| Bad      | €5 400 | 3 | 1 800 | Too low once social-security + 13th/14th pay included |
| Good     | €7 500 | 4 | 1 875 | Still lean; budget €2 100+ |
| Awesome | €9 600 | 5 | 1 920 | Ditto |

**Recommendation:** Re-forecast labour at €2 100–€2 200/FTE and add overtime buffer.

---
## 4  Occupancy

Rent fixed €3 500/mo.  
• Bad-case rent ≈13.6 % of gross—already high. Target <10 %.  
• Either negotiate €2 500–€3 000 rent or lift revenue.

Utilities modelled at 2–3 % of sales—fine but revisit if using electric deck ovens.

---
## 5  Operating Expenses

| Line | Current | Reality Check |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Insurance | €300–€450/mo | OK for wood-fired risk |
| Marketing | €450–€900/mo | Good for year-1; taper later |
| Other Operating | €750–€1 500/mo | Too low once you separate delivery & card fees (~3 % of gross) |

**Action:** Add dedicated “Delivery & Card Fees” line (2.8–3.2 % of gross incl. VAT).

---
## 6  EBITDA & Net Profit Realism

| Scenario | EBITDA % | Net % | Verdict |
|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| Bad | 21 % | 16.5 % | Slightly rosy but defensible |
| Good | 37 % | 36.8 % | Needs higher labour + fees; expect ~25 % net |
| Awesome | 46 % | 48.2 % | Implausible; cap net at ~30 % |

Drivers inflating Awesome: low labour scaling, fixed costs flat, static interest.

---
## 7  Depreciation & Interest

• Depreciation (€12.6–€18 k) matches €126–€180 k cap-ex over 10 yrs.  
• Interest (€5.4–€9 k) feels light if financing ≥70 % of equipment—verify loan size & rate.

---
## 8  VAT & Cash-Flow Timing

VAT remitted monthly/quarterly—add working-capital line for VAT cash lag to avoid Q1 squeeze.

---
## 9  Sensitivity Case (Add to Sheet)

• 65 covers/day, AOV €19  
• COGS 31 %, Labour 4 FTE @ €2.1 k  
• Rent 12 % of sales, Delivery 3 %  
Expect net margin 15–17 %—anchor for lenders.

---
## 10  Next-Step Checklist

1. Re-forecast labour with statutory burden & overtime.  
2. Isolate delivery/card fees.  
3. Stress-test rent at 12 % of sales.  
4. Cap "Awesome" net at ~30 % for credibility.  
5. Build 12-month cash-flow incl. VAT, loan amortisation, and replacement cap-ex.

---
**Bottom Line**  
Framework is solid but Awesome-case margins are overstated. Tighten labour, rent, and aggregator fees to create a bullet-proof, investor-friendly model.
