##### Daily Metrics Log

Today I worked on DearMachine. I think the implementation is mostly complete, and tomorrow I'll spend time testing it. I also reviewed my notes and cleaned up the templates. I definitely made progress on the DearMachine development.

##### 60-sec Reflection

I'm satisfied with what I achieved today. Refining my work with the agent was productive - I now have ideas I can implement and code I can reuse. The folder structure improvements were also valuable. However, I still spend too much time on maintenance tasks like cleaning up and closing browser tabs. Tomorrow I should focus on closing just one or two browser tabs at a time. The main priority is removing unnecessary instructions.
