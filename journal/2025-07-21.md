##### Daily Metrics Log

Today I worked on DearMachine. Bayer and a bit of dectris.

Dearmachines is at a good stage to be tested locally. Tomorrow the focus is probably on it and finishing the UI.

##### 60-sec Reflection

Not really satisfied by what I got today, I still get a lot of distraction.
Still plenty of tasks and notes to go through.
Maybe chunking will work?
